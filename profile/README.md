Hello! We are **Wordplay**, a community of researchers, educators, designers, developers, and other contributors who are working towards a vision of **justice-centered programming languages**. 

By justice, we mean programming languages that:

* Are accessible, usable, and expressive for everyone, regardless of their abilities, language fluency, and way of reasoning, communicating, and collaborating;
* Can be shaped everyone through shared governance, but particularly creators whose identities, voices, and experiences have been historically ignored in programming language design;
* Are used for computation that advances justice by dismantling hierarchies of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and language, and creating more equitable visions for society, rather than reifying our histories of war, profit, and colonization.

[Wordplay](https://wordplay.dev) is our playground for exploring these ideas, through, research, practice, teaching, learning, and community building. Learn [how to contribute](https://github.com/wordplaydev/wordplay/wiki).

# About

Wordplay is led by a team at the University of Washington, facilitated by Professor [Amy Ko](https://amyko.phd/). She's a trans, queer, person of color who views this project partly as a refuge for everyone who's felt themselves a misfit in computing cultures, and wants to build a radically diverse community across our many intersecting identities. Whether that describes you or not, all are welcome to help if they want to advance the vision above!
